## üß† Why MongoDB over PostgreSQL?

-**‚úÖ Flexibility for Menu Data**
Menu items often contain semi-structured or optional fields such as:

imageUrl, tags, description, customizations, etc.
MongoDB allows schema-less flexibility, making it ideal for dynamic and evolving menu structures without enforcing rigid rules.

-**‚úÖ Developer Speed & Simplicity**
MongoDB enables rapid development, especially in early-stage projects or prototypes. With Mongoose, validation and modeling become easier without setting up extensive schemas or dealing with complex joins.

-**‚úÖ Natural Fit for Orders**
Order objects contain arrays of items, total amount, and customer contact info. This structure is perfectly suited for MongoDB‚Äôs nested document model, which makes retrieval and storage more efficient without needing relational mapping.

-**‚úÖ Future-Ready for Scalability**
MongoDB scales horizontally and is a great fit for modern, high-speed web applications where read-heavy workloads (like fetching menus/orders) are common.
